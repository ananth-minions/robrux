### Are you here for the first time?

Use your favorite package manager ([npm/yarn](https://www.stackshare.io/stackups/npm-vs-yarn)) to install the dependencies.

Run `npm run storyboard` to see some of the components in action (some environment variables might be needed â€“ read below).

### Appetite for development?

Create and edit a valid `.env` file by doing `cp .env.sample .env`. Start your local MongoDB server or setup a remote one in the said `.env` file. Run `npm run seed` and wait for the mock data to be imported. Congratulations, you're all set.

Now run `npm run start:dev` and create something nice. PRs are welcome.
